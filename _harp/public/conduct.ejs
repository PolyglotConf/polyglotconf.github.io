                    We strive to be inclusive and keep events comfortable and fun for everyone. Our code of conduct

                    the spirit of <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com/">http://confcodeofconduct.com/</a>. Our events
                    are
                    dedicated to providing a harassment-free
                    experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
                    appearance,
                    body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual
                    language
                    and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other
                    online media. Participants violating these rules may be expelled at the discretion of the
                    organizers. If
                    we, the organizers, say or do something that makes you feel uncomfortable, please let us know.

                <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem
